        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p id="aboutMe">I am a recent graduate of the University of California, San Diego with a BS degree in Mathematics-Computer Science. 
            I have a strong background focussing on programming, mathematical and computational theory as well as numerical analysis. <br>
            I have an interest in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics. I am eager to learn more about these topics. I have learned 
            algorithms in search and reasoning that solve games like Blackjack and Sudoku. Also, I have learned Computer Graphics through low-level 
            implementation with OpenGL. Also, I have a clear understanding of programming languages such as Java, C/C++, Python, C#, Matlab, and HTML. <br>
            During my undergraduate education, I was an esports competitor playing <i>Splatoon 2</i> in UCSD's <b>Triton Splatoon</b>. My favorite hobbies
            are running, swimming, and table tennis. I have a big interest in gaming, but also in health and fitness.

            <h3>Productivity Extension</h3>
                <p>A Google Chrome extension that will help the user be more productive while using Google Chrome. The extension blocks websites based 
                    on the URL with a click of a button. It also includes a timer to motivate the user to keep being productive. This program was 
                    written in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This was worked on from September-October 2020.<br>

                </p>
            <h3>YouTube-to-Spotify Playlist Transfer</h3>
                <p>The program takes a music playlist from YouTube and creates a new playlist on Spotify. The program will ask the user for information
                     on the playlist the user wants to copy from (name and link). After the program saved the user information, the program will scrape 
                     the names of the songs and artists from the YouTube playlist. It will create a new playlist and will transfer all of the songs.
                     I wrote this program in JavaScript. It uses NodeJS, Puppeteer, and readline-sync. This was worked on from July-August 2020.<br>

            <h3>Price Tracker</h3>
                <p>The application takes a product and keeps track of the price locally. It was written in Python and uses Selenium to track the price 
                    changes from a website based on a time interval. It was worked on from June 2018 - Januaury 2020. <br>

                <h4>Tropical Island Bunny</h4>
                <p>
                    This project implemented technical Computer Graphics features that include: toon shading, procedurally generated clouds, 
                    procedurally generated terrain, procedurally generated plants with L-systems, collision detection, and FPS camera movements.
                    The team finished this final project for the Computer Graphics course at UCSD.
                    We wrote this program in C++ and GLSL for the shader files. It was worked on from Feburary - March 2020. <br>

                </p>
                <h4>2048</h4>
                    <p>
                        Recreated a popular mobile game in which the user moves tiles on a 4x4 grid, from two 2 or 4 tiles to a 2048 tile. Tools: Java.
                        I wrote this project for the course, Introduction of Computer Science: Java (II), at UCSD.
                    </p>
                <h4>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</h4>
                    <p>
                        Project descriptionThe application takes a movie or an actor and finds a link to the infamous actor, Kevin Bacon, in 6 steps or less. Tools: C++.
                        I wrote this program in the course, Advanced Data Structures, at UCSD.
